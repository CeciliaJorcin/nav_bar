# React Navigation Bar Component

This project creates a **responsive navigation bar** component that adjusts its appearance and behavior based on the screen size and scroll events.

The navigation bar includes a **logo** and a customizable list of **menu items** (or hamburger button for toggling the navigation menu on mobile). The navigation bar's style and behavior are responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and scroll events.

It uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) to manage state and handle scroll events. It uses a configuration file **(./config.js)** that contains constants and values used for styling and configuration purposes.

### Features

- **Responsive design**: The navigation bar adapts its layout and style based on different screen sizes.
- **Scroll behavior**: The navigation bar adjusts its appearance based on the scroll position of the page.
- **Configurable options**: The component provides configuration options for customizing the initial height, final height, transparency, logo images, backdrop filter, and menu items.
